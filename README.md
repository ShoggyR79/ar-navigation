# AR Indoor Navigation Project

## Project Overview

The AR Indoor Navigation project is designed to innovate the way individuals navigate through indoor spaces by leveraging augmented reality (AR) and the latest technological advancements. Focused on enhancing the navigation experience within a residence hall, this project uses the Vuforia Area Target iOS app with the iPad Pro's LiDAR camera for spatial mapping, combined with Unity for AR development. Our goal is to provide a user-friendly navigation solution that guides users to specific rooms within the residence hall with ease and precision.

## Technologies and APIs

### Vuforia Engine with Vuforia Area Target iOS App

- **Purpose**: To generate accurate 3D mappings of indoor environments and recognize specific areas and objects, facilitating an interactive AR navigation experience.
- **Usage**: Utilizing the Vuforia Area Target iOS app on an iPad Pro, we will generate detailed mappings of a residence hall floor. These mappings serve as the foundation for our AR navigation system, allowing the app to recognize and interact with the hall's layout.

### iPad Pro's LiDAR Camera

- **Purpose**: To accurately map the layout and dimensions of the residence hall floor, providing essential data for spatial awareness and navigation.
- **Usage**: The LiDAR technology in the iPad Pro captures depth information and spatial data, which is then processed and utilized to create a comprehensive 3D model of the indoor environment.

### Unity Engine

- **Purpose**: To develop the AR application by integrating spatial data, image targets, and AR content into an immersive and interactive experience.
- **Usage**: Unity serves as the development platform for our AR indoor navigation system, where we integrate the mappings generated by the Vuforia Area Target iOS app and the spatial data captured by the LiDAR camera. Unity's powerful tools allow us to develop the navigation logic, user interface, and AR visualization features.

## Project Features

- **Detailed Indoor Navigation**: Seamlessly navigate through a residence hall floor to find specific rooms and points of interest.
- **Spatial Mapping and Recognition**: Employ the Vuforia Area Target app and LiDAR data to understand the environment fully, ensuring accurate localization and pathfinding.
- **Interactive AR Visuals**: Experience guided navigation through AR cues, enhancing the wayfinding process and making it more intuitive.

## Objective

Our project aims to redefine indoor navigation within residence halls through advanced AR technology, providing a precise, easy-to-use solution for residents and visitors. By combining detailed spatial mapping with interactive AR elements, we seek to improve spatial orientation and enhance the overall navigation experience within indoor settings.
